# MasterSlaveApp
This repository contains 2 Android application namely, MasterApp and SlaveApp.
SlaveApp is basically a media player which can access local media content and can play it and 
MasterApp is the application which can control the operation regarding the media player(can pause/play the media file
, can controls the volume, can change the brightness, etc.).Currently the project is on progress.
Have implemented the basic features and working on the remaining one. Will update the repository when done.
